### ReadyCI
A no-fuss CI/CD tool for iOS and Android apps
    
## Why use ReadyCI?

- **ReadyCI comes with build scripts** so that you spend less time setting up your automated CI/CD infrastructure, and get to making automated builds faster. ReadyCI scripts currently support:
iOS apps, Android apps, Maven projects and Sonarqube.

- **Runs as command-line or web-service.** You can run ReadyCI on the command-line within another CI environment like Jenkins, or run ReadyCI as a service on it's own and accept web-hook calls from GIT services like Github and Bitbucket.

- **Supports web-hooks.** ReadyCI supports GIT commit web-hooks when you run it in server mode so that your automated builds start as soon as you push to your git repository. ReadyCI supports web-hooks from GitHub and BitBucket.

- **Parses iOS provisioning profiles.** Configuring iOS builds is tricky. ReadyCI uses the .mobileprovision file generated by Apple Developer Portal to automatically configure your build and remove some of the guess-work behind making your iOS app build successful. ReadyCI also keeps the provisioning profiles on CI agent up-to-date. All you need to do is commit updated provisioning profiles to your GIT repository and ReadyCI will take it from there.

- **Deploys to App Store Connect, Google Play and Hockeyapp.** ReadyCI can automatically deploy your app to Hockeyapp or the respective app stores. Just add the appropriate task and credentials and ReadyCI will get your upload your build for you.

- **Keeps credentials safe.** ReadyCI allows you to split configuration accross multiple configuration files so that you can keep your credentials safely on your CI server and out of your GIT repository.

## Quick Start
Download ReadyCI From https://readyci.org 

Run a once off build by specifying the path to a **configuration file** and an appropriate **pipeline name**. It's only fitting that ReadyCI be able to build itself! Have a look at the example below which builds ReadyCI and copies the artefact to the /tmp/ folder. 
 
```bash
$ java -jar readyci.jar readyci_config_example.yml pipeline=readyci

Loaded configuration readyci_config_example.yml with 2 pipelines
...
ReadyCI is in command-line mode
Building pipline readyci
...
FINISHED BUILD 74e404d8-6bae-41fa-8aa1-4d786c797c58 
```  
A successful build will deploy `readyci.jar` to your `/tmp/` directory. You can check that it's there like this:
```bash
$ ls -la /tmp/*.jar 
-rw-r--r--  1 bradley  wheel  16612035 Jun 13 12:30 /tmp/readyci.jar
```
Try this out yourself using the configuration `readyci_config_example.yml` to run a ReadyCI build named `readyci`.
